### Key Technical Achievements:
- Learned and integrated with a complex custom game engine to implement a particle simulation system handling 10K+ concurrent particles at 60 FPS
- Implemented double-buffered render with game/render thread separation, reducing frame time variance
- Developed a debug visualization framework for real-time AABB/OBB collision boundaries
- Created a modular particle physics system with parametric spiral motion paths and dynamic color transitions 
- Built ImGui-based configuration interface for real-time particle parameter tuning and performance monitoring
